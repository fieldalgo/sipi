# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Validate installed first-party files against exact wheels before regression, reject same-version stale or shadowed imports, and preserve failed-run JSON evidence without stale passing XML.

- Extract SIPI as an independent distribution with unchanged numerical implementation, JSON contracts and regression fixtures. Retain galerkin and meshine as external dependencies.
